# Step 5: Basic data analysis
# Compute the basic statistics of numerical columns
print("\nBasic statistics of numerical columns:")
print(df_cleaned.describe()) # type: ignore

# Step 6: Perform groupings and compute the mean of a numerical column for each category
# For example, grouping by 'species' and computing the mean of 'sepalLengthCm'
grouped_data = df_cleaned.groupby('species')['sepalLengthCm'].mean() # type: ignore
print("\nMean Sepal Length by Species:")
print(grouped_data)

# Identify any interesting patterns or findings
# The mean sepal length varies by species, which could be useful for classification tasks
